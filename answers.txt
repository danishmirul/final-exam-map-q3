Question (a):
JSON deserialization is a process of converting data from JSON into Map.
This is useful because of when the client receive the data converted from JSON into Map,
we could use it so that we could implements the data into the application.
In Flutter we could implements Map to show the data or to process the data.


Question (b):
futurebuilder, this is because this widget will wait for the data to be retrieve in snapshot. 
If the snapshot is empty, we could use it to make our app to show the loading screen.
Meanwhile when the snapshot.data retrieve data we will make process for it instead of showing loading screen.
